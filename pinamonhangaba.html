Cordelius is a Legendary Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 in Season 19: Enchanted Woods, or can be obtained from the Starr Road. He has moderate health and damage output, and a very fast movement speed. His Trait allows Cordelius to passively charge his Super if an enemy Brawler is within a radius of him. He attacks by firing two mushrooms from his gardening tool. For his Super, he shoots a large mushroom that allows him and his enemy Brawler to transport them to the Shadow Realm, temporarily increasing his movement speed and decreasing his attack's reload time. Enemies affected by Cordelius' Super can't use their Super, Gadget, or Hypercharge, and Cordelius can't use either of his Gadgets in the Shadow Realm. His first Gadget, Replanting, makes Cordelius jump forward. His second Gadget, Poison Mushroom, Cordelius fires a mushroom onto an enemy that deals damage on hit. Enemies affected by Cordelius' Gadget can't attack or use their Super, Gadget, or Hypercharge. His first Star Power, Comboshrooms, increases his second attack projectile's damage on a target. His second Star Power, Mushroom Kingdom, spawns mushrooms in the Shadow Realm that heal Cordelius or damage enemies over time. His Hypercharge, Complete Darkness, slows enemies down in the Shadow Realm.
